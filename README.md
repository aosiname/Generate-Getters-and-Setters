Generate-Getters-and-Setters
============================

Something I wrote a while ago because I missed the generate getters and setters that Eclipse gives you in for Java. You can look at POG (PHP Object Generator) but its overkill if you are not connecting to DB etc. There is also this: https://github.com/docteurklein/php-getter-setter.vim/blob/master/ftplugin/php_getset.vim but havent tried it yet.
